# This function will read data from a file using "r" mode. It will use the context manager with to open and close the file automatically. It will return a list of dictionaries with cat data from the file, as required. It will split each line by comma and get the three parts as id, name, and age. However, it will not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur while opening or reading the file. If you want to make your code more robust, you will need to add some error handling mechanisms

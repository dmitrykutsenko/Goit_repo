#function that will compare two strings in different encodings and return True if they are equal, and False if not. Here is one possible solution:

def is_equal_string(utf8_string, utf16_string):

    #Decode the utf-8 string into a unicode object
    utf8_unicode = utf8_string.decode("utf-8")

    #Decode the utf-16 string into a unicode object
    utf16_unicode = utf16_string.decode("utf-16")

    #Compare the two unicode objects for equality
    return utf8_unicode == utf16_unicode

#This function will decode the utf-8 and utf-16 strings into unicode objects using the decode method. It will then compare the two unicode objects for equality using the == operator. It will return True if they are equal, and False if not. However, it will not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur while decoding or comparing the strings. If you want to make your code more robust, you will need to add some error handling mechanisms.

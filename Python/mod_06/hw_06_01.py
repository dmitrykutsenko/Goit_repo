def total_salary(path):

    # Initialize the total salary as zero
    total = 0

    # Open the file in read mode
    file = open(path, "r")

    # Loop until the end of the file
    while True:

        #Read one line from the file
        line = file.readline()

        # If the line is empty, break the loop
        if not line:
            break

        # Split the line by comma and get the second element as salary
        salary = float(line.split(",")[1])

        # Add the salary to the total
        total += salary

    # Close the file
    file.close()

    # Return the total salary
    return total

# This function will return a float value that represents the sum of all the salaries in the file. It will use only the readline method to read the file line by line, and it will not use the context manager with. However, it will not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur while opening or reading the file. If you want to make your code more robust, you will need to add some error handling mechanisms.

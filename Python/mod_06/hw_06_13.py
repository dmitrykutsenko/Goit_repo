# function that will create a backup of a folder containing a binary file with employee residence data. Here is one possible solution:

# Import the shutil module
import shutil

def create_backup(path, file_name, employee_residence):

    # Create the full file path by joining the path and the file name
    file_path = path + "/" + file_name

    # Use the context manager with to open the file in binary write mode
    with open(file_path, "wb") as file:

        # Loop through the employee_residence dictionary
        for username, country in employee_residence.items():

            # Create a string with the username and country, separated by a space
            data = f"{username} {country}\n"

            # Encode the string into bytes using utf-8 encoding
            data = data.encode("utf-8")

            # Write the bytes to the file
            file.write(data)

        # Create a zip archive of the folder using shutil.make_archive
        archive_path = shutil.make_archive("backup_folder", "zip", path)

    #Return the archive path
    return archive_path

# This function will create a backup of a folder containing a binary file with employee residence data. It will import the shutil module to perform the archiving. It will create the full file path by joining the path and the file name using the / character. It will use the context manager with to open and close the file automatically. It will loop through the employee_residence dictionary and create a string with the username and country, separated by a space, for each employee. It will encode the string into bytes using utf-8 encoding and write it to the file using the write method. It will create a zip archive of the folder using shutil.make_archive and name it backup_folder.zip. It will return the archive path as a string. However, it will not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur while opening, writing, or archiving the files

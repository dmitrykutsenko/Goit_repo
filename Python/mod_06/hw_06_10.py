# function that will write the user's login and password to a binary file. Here is one possible solution:

def save_credentials_users(path, users_info):

    # Use the context manager with to open the file in binary write mode
    with open(path, "wb") as file:

        # Loop through the users_info dictionary
        for username, password in users_info.items():

            # Create a string with the username and password, separated by a colon
            data = f"{username}:{password}\n"

            # Encode the string into bytes using utf-8 encoding
            data = data.encode("utf-8")

            # Write the bytes to the file
            file.write(data)

# The file will be automatically closed by the context manager
# This function will do the same thing as the previous one, but it will use the context manager with to open and close the file automatically. This is a more elegant and safe way of working with files in Python

# This function will store information about users with passwords in a binary file. It will open the file in binary write mode using the path parameter. It will loop through the users_info dictionary and create a string with the username and password, separated by a colon, for each user. It will encode the string into bytes using utf-8 encoding and write the bytes to the file. It will close the file after writing all the data. However, it will not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur while opening or writing to the file. If you want to make your code more robust, you will need to add some error handling mechanisms

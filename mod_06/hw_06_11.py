#function that will return a list of strings from the binary file created in the previous task. Here is one possible solution:

def get_credentials_users(path):

    #Initialize the user list as empty
    user_list = []

    #Use the context manager with to open the file in binary read mode
    with open(path, "rb") as file:

        #Loop through each line in the file
        for line in file:

            #Decode the bytes into a string using utf-8 encoding
            data = line.decode("utf-8")

            #Remove the newline character from the data
            data = data.strip()

            #Add the data to the user list
            user_list.append(data)

    #Return the user list
    return user_list

#This function will return a list of strings from the binary file created in the previous task. It will use the context manager with to open and close the file automatically. It will loop through each line in the file and decode the bytes into a string using utf-8 encoding. It will remove the newline character from the data and add it to the user list. It will return the user list in the format that you specified. However, it will not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur while opening or reading the file. If you want to make your code more robust, you will need to add some error handling mechanisms
